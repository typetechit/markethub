                protection laws. This includes countries which the EU Commission does not consider to have an
                adequate level of protection for personal data. If this occurs, we will ensure there is a legal
                ground for the transfer in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. You will also be
                informed about the legal ground, what safeguards were implemented, and where you can obtain a copy
                of information on these safeguards. Swoogo and our client (Controller) have executed a data
                processing agreement that includes Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission
